# fractals

This project creates colorful fractals designed with interactive components based on different keyboard and mouse events. Like 3d_wireframe, it uses the minilibx library to plot images onto the screen.

## Key Details

The project was a great learning experience on child processes and multithreading as they are necessary to maintain the fluidity of the program. On line 112 in main, a child procress is created with a successful fork. From there, the child process runs the rest of the program while the parent process completes the execution of main. Depending on whether the user wants to open more than one fractal at a time, the forking for a new process sits inside a while loop so multiple processes can be created for each respective fractal.

The next interesting function is the initialization of the environment struct pointer. It is the main struct pointer in the program and it holds the data needed for connecting to the mlx server in minilibx. From lines 74 to 83 in 'init_env', various pointers are set to function calls within this project and the minilibx library. For example, the pointers in lines 75 and 81 connect to the mlx functions required for creating both the window itself and the graphical image which spawns onto that window. Line 82 holds an integer array that stores data needed for later calculations. Lines 78 to 80 initiliaze the other struct pointers in this project for modification with the key and mouse hooks.

In line 78 above, the called function 'handle_color' will be examined next. The format in this function serves as a template for the other handlers and demonstrates how the fractals are colored.

After memory is allocated and set for the t_color struct pointer, it is passed through 10 coloring functions. Each coloring functions holds an integer array of 24 hard-coded hex values that are based on pleasing color palettes found online. This integer array is then transfered into the rgb member at an indexed position (9 in the example below) of the t_color struct pointer. The format of the function below is replicated for all 10 coloring functions.

Two other important members of the environment struct pointer are the function pointers to 'reset_func' and 'redraw_func'. These two members hold the project's multithreading aspect and many of it's calculations. The 'redraw_func' function in particular is worth exploring in depth.

<img width="482" alt="screen shot 2017-08-09 at 5 15 38 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13093517/29237171-5b045aca-7ecd-11e7-82d3-0b578b7a97cf.png">

An array of type pthread_t is created on line 32 of 'redraw_func' which stores the threads that calculate the coordinates to be drawn. The array is filled in the running of the while loop on line 35 before being terminated in the following while loop on line 38. The rest of the function then outputs the determined values and resets them after the output has been accomplished. On line 36, 'handle_threads' passes back each newly created pthread_t which holds the function ultimately responsible for the coloring and placement of each coordinate. These coordinates are found by running through all of the x and y values of the window and, depending on the type of fractal, computing the math needed to determine each coordinate. The placement of each coordinate follows a simple format inspired from this wonderful resource below:

An example of the math needed to create the Mandelbrot set (shortened to simply 'mand' in the function below) can be found in this snippet:
